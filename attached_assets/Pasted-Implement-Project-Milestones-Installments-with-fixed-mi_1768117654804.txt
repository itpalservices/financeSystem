Implement Project Milestones (Installments) with fixed milestone types and automatic naming.

Goal:
Each Project can have milestones (installments). The milestone type dropdown must only have:
1) Advance Payment
2) Progress Payment
3) Final Payment

Rules:
- A Project may have at most ONE Advance Payment milestone and at most ONE Final Payment milestone.
- A Project may have multiple Progress Payment milestones.
- Progress Payment milestones must be automatically labeled with an incrementing number per project:
  - First one: "Progress Payment 1"
  - Second one: "Progress Payment 2"
  - Third one: "Progress Payment 3"
  - etc.
- The user should NOT manually type the number; the system assigns it automatically based on existing Progress milestones for that project.

Data model:
Create table `project_milestones` with fields:
- id (PK)
- project_id (FK -> projects.id)
- milestone_type (ENUM: ADVANCE, PROGRESS, FINAL)
- milestone_no (INT, nullable)  // used only for PROGRESS, stores 1..N
- label (STRING)               // display label (Advance Payment / Progress Payment X / Final Payment)
- expected_amount (DECIMAL)
- due_date (DATE, nullable)
- status (ENUM: PLANNED, INVOICED, PAID) default PLANNED
- created_at, updated_at

Logic for creation:
When creating a milestone:
- If milestone_type = ADVANCE:
  - Validate no existing ADVANCE milestone for the same project. If exists, block with a clear error.
  - Set label = "Advance Payment", milestone_no = null
- If milestone_type = FINAL:
  - Validate no existing FINAL milestone for the same project. If exists, block with a clear error.
  - Set label = "Final Payment", milestone_no = null
- If milestone_type = PROGRESS:
  - Compute next number:
      nextNo = (MAX(milestone_no) for PROGRESS milestones in same project) + 1, starting from 1.
  - Set milestone_no = nextNo
  - Set label = "Progress Payment " + nextNo

Important (concurrency-safe):
Ensure numbering is safe if two users add a Progress Payment at the same time:
- Use a DB transaction and row-level locking OR
- Enforce a unique co
