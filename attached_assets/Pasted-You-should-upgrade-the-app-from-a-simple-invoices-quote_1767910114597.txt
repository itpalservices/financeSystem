You should upgrade the app from a “simple invoices/quotes tool” into a more robust records system by (1) replacing deletion of any issued document with a proper Void/Cancel flow that stores reason, canceled_at, canceled_by and keeps the PDF/record forever, and by locking issued documents so they cannot be edited after issuing (corrections should happen via void/cancel and re-issue, or optionally via credit notes later). (2) Improve document numbering to be year-based and series-based and enforced at the database level (unique + sequential), e.g. QUO-2026-000001, INV-2026-000001, and REC-2026-000001 (since you also do payment receipts), and store additional metadata such as issued_at and issued_by. (3) Add an audit log that records who did what and when (login, create, edit, issue, send email, generate PDF, void/cancel), and store a snapshot of customer details inside each issued document so historical documents never change if a customer profile is later updated. (4) Make “payment receipt” a first-class document with required fields like payment_date, amount_paid, payment_method, and optional payment_reference, and allow linking a receipt to a related quote/invoice/project for traceability. (5) Expand quotes with practical statuses and workflow: draft/sent/accepted/rejected/expired, keep valid_until, and add quote versioning (v1/v2) so a sent quote isn’t silently modified; when converting a quote to a draft invoice, preserve a reference like “Created from QUO-…”, and lock or version the quote after acceptance/conversion. (6) Add basic company-grade security and operations: simple roles (admin/issuer/viewer), optional 2FA, login rate limiting, and reliable backups for both the database and stored PDFs, plus a retention policy to keep records for years. For performance and UX, implement server-side pagination and indexing for searches (document number, customer name/company, phone/email), cache dashboard counts, and generate PDFs on issue then store them (don’t regenerate every time). Nice-to-have upgrades that add a “professional” feel are a line-item service/product catalog with autocomplete, one-click duplicate/recurring documents, richer analytics (monthly totals, top customers, quote conversion rate), export to CSV/Excel for accounting, email templates with CC/BCC and send-tracking, and optional automation (reminders for quote expiry or follow-ups).
